# Excersie 2: http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex2.html

# Since I'm not completely new to ruby or programming I won't do everything in every exercise
# However I will probably still do the extra credit.

#============================================================================================
#= Extra Credit:
#= 
#= Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
#= Take your ex2.rb file and review each line going backwards. Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
#= Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
#= Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
